# About Step-06

To configure a Multibranch Pipeline job with a GitHub webhook trigger using the "Multibranch Scan Webhook Trigger" plugin in Jenkins, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Plugin:**
   If you haven't already, install the "Multibranch Scan Webhook Trigger" plugin from the Jenkins Plugin Manager. You can find it by searching for "Multibranch Scan Webhook Trigger" and installing it.

2. **GitHub Webhook Setup:**
   In your GitHub repository, set up a webhook to notify Jenkins of changes. Make sure you have repository administrator access to set up webhooks.

   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on "Settings" > "Webhooks" > "Add webhook".
   - For "Payload URL," provide the Jenkins URL followed by `/github-webhook/`. Example: `https://your-jenkins-domain/github-webhook/`.
   - Set the content type to "application/json".
   - Choose the events you want to trigger the webhook (e.g., "Push" events).
   - Create the webhook.

3. **Configure Multibranch Pipeline:**

   - Create a new Multibranch Pipeline job in Jenkins or modify an existing one.
   - In the job configuration, under "Scan Multibranch Pipeline Triggers," check "Periodically if not otherwise run" and set the "Interval" to a reasonable value (e.g., 1 minute). This will make sure the plugin regularly checks for changes.
   - Check "Build whenever a webhook is received." This option allows the plugin to trigger builds on webhook events.

4. **Save Configuration:**
   Save the configuration of your Multibranch Pipeline job.

5. **Test Webhook Trigger:**
   Make a small change in one of your repository's branches and push the changes to GitHub. This should trigger the webhook and, consequently, the Multibranch Pipeline job in Jenkins.

6. **View Build Logs:**
   After the webhook is triggered, the Multibranch Pipeline job should start building the affected branch. You can view the build logs and status in the Jenkins web interface.

By configuring the "Multibranch Scan Webhook Trigger" plugin and setting up a GitHub webhook, you enable automated triggering of Jenkins builds whenever there are new commits or changes in your GitHub repository. This enhances your CI/CD workflow by ensuring that Jenkins responds to code changes promptly and automatically.
