# About Step-08

To integrate JFrog Artifactory with Jenkins, you need to add JFrog credentials to Jenkins and then install and configure the JFrog Artifactory plugin. Here's how you can do it:

### Add JFrog Credentials to Jenkins:

1. **Log in to Jenkins:**
   Log in to your Jenkins Master's web interface.

2. **Access Credentials:**
   Click on "Manage Jenkins" from the home page, and then select "Manage Credentials" from the dropdown.

3. **Add Credentials:**
   Click on the "Global" domain (or any other domain you prefer) and then click on "Add Credentials" from the left-hand side menu.

4. **Choose Credentials Kind:**
   In the "Add Credentials" page, select the kind of credentials you want to add. For JFrog Artifactory integration, you might choose "Secret text."

5. **Fill in Details:**
   - Secret: Provide the API key or access token for your JFrog Artifactory account.
   - ID: A unique identifier for these credentials.
   - Description (Optional): Add a description to help you identify these credentials later.

6. **Save Credentials:**
   Click the "OK" or "Save" button to save the credentials. They will now be available for use in Jenkins.

### Install and Configure JFrog Artifactory Plugin:

1. **Install the Plugin:**
   If you haven't already, install the "JFrog Artifactory" plugin from the Jenkins Plugin Manager. You can find it by searching for "JFrog Artifactory" and installing it.

2. **Configure Artifactory Server:**
   - After installing the plugin, go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System".
   - Scroll down to the "Artifactory" section.
   - Click on "Add Artifactory Server" to configure your Artifactory instance.

3. **Provide Server Details:**
   - In the "Artifactory Server" configuration, provide a name for the server.
   - Set the URL of your Artifactory instance.
   - Choose the credentials you added earlier from the dropdown.
   - You can configure additional settings such as repository keys, timeout settings, and more.

4. **Test Connection (Optional):**
   You can test the connection to your Artifactory server to ensure the configuration is correct.

5. **Save Configuration:**
   Click the "Save" or "Apply" button to save the Artifactory server configuration.

### Using JFrog Artifactory in Jenkins Jobs:

Once the JFrog Artifactory plugin is installed and configured, you can use it in your Jenkins jobs to perform tasks like uploading and downloading artifacts to and from Artifactory repositories.

For example, you can use the "Artifactory Generic Upload" or "Artifactory Generic Download" steps in your Jenkinsfile to interact with Artifactory repositories.

Remember to adapt your Jenkins job configurations and Jenkinsfile to use the JFrog Artifactory plugin as needed for your specific build and deployment processes.
