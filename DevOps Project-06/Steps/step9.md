# About Step-09

To create a Docker image from a JAR file, commit the image to a Docker repository in JFrog Artifactory using the Docker Pipeline plugin in Jenkins, you can follow this example Jenkinsfile:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Build your project and generate the JAR file
                sh 'mvn clean package' // Replace with your build command
            }
        }

        stage('Docker Build and Publish') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Build Docker image using the JAR file
                    def dockerImage = docker.build("your-docker-image-name:${BUILD_NUMBER}", '.')

                    // Authenticate with Artifactory Docker registry
                    docker.withRegistry('https://your-artifactory-url', 'your-artifactory-credentials-id') {
                        // Push the Docker image to Artifactory repository
                        dockerImage.push()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            // This block executes if the pipeline succeeds
            echo 'Pipeline succeeded!'
        }

        failure {
            // This block executes if the pipeline fails
            echo 'Pipeline failed!'
        }
    }
}
```

Here's an explanation of the key sections:

1. **Build Docker Image:**
   - The `docker.build` command creates a Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory ('.').
   - Replace `"your-docker-image-name:${BUILD_NUMBER}"` with your desired image name and tag.

2. **Push Docker Image to Artifactory:**
   - The `docker.withRegistry` block pushes the Docker image to your Artifactory repository.
   - Replace `'https://your-artifactory-url'` with your Artifactory URL and `'your-artifactory-credentials-id'` with the ID of the Docker registry credentials added to Jenkins.

Remember to replace placeholders like `your-docker-image-name`, `https://your-artifactory-url`, and `your-artifactory-credentials-id` with actual values.

This Jenkinsfile defines a Docker Pipeline with stages for building your project, creating a Docker image, and pushing it to the Artifactory Docker repository. Adjust the stages and commands as needed to match your project's structure and requirements.
